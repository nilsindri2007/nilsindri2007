Backend:
☕ Java: My go-to language for robust, enterprise-grade applications.
🍃 Spring Boot: Building high-performance, production-ready microservices is a breeze with Spring Boot.
NoSQL: 🌿 MongoDB: A true NoSQL enthusiast, I love its flexibility and scalability for handling diverse data.
Frontend:

⚛️ React: Crafting dynamic, interactive, and user-friendly interfaces that deliver exceptional user experiences.
JavaScript/TypeScript: The backbone of modern web development.
HTML/CSS: Laying the foundation for beautiful and responsive designs.

🐳 Docker: Containerizing applications for consistency across environments.
☸️ Kubernetes: Orchestrating containerized workloads for high availability and scalability.
CI/CD: Jenkins / GitHub Actions / GitLab CI (mention what you've used)
Version Control: Git
What I'm Currently Excited About:
Exploring [mention a specific new tech/framework, e.g., Spring WebFlux, Next.js, a specific AWS service].
Diving deeper into [e.g., event-driven architectures, real-time data processing].
Contributing to open-source projects.
